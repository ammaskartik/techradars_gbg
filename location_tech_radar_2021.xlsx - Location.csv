AWS ElasticSearch,Hold,Platforms,TRUE,"AWS's managed ElasticSearch offering was recently targeted by a code license change by ELasticSearch's owners, which has prompted AWS to fork ElasticSearch. Although backwards compatibility is promised and it might develop into a superior service, until more information on AWS's plans with their own fork are made public, we advice to hold on using this managed service. "
Homemade infrastructure-as-code (IaC) products,Hold,Platforms,FALSE,"Products supported by companies or communities are in constant evolution, at least the ones that get traction in the industry. Sometimes organizations tend to build frameworks or abstractions on top of the existing external products to cover very specific needs, thinking that the adaptation will provide more benefits than the existing ones. Organizations trying to create homemade infrastructure-as-code (IaC) products on top of the existing ones; they underestimate the required effort to keep those solutions evolving according to their needs, and after a short period of time, they realize that the original version is in much better shape than their own; there are even cases where the abstraction on top of the external product reduces the original capabilities. Although we've seen success stories of organizations building homemade solutions, we want to caution about this approach as the effort required to do so isn't negligible, and a long-term product vision is required to have the expected outcomes."
OpenFaaS etc,Hold,Platforms,FALSE,"Projects such as OpenFaaS that aim to create cloud agnostic serveless frameworks typically need execution of these framewoirks on self managed kubernetes clusters. The overhead and a feature set which lags cloud-native implementations, mean it's currently better to pick a serverless impementation such as AWS Lambda or Azure Funtions."

Currently in Beta, but with extensive language support and ecosystem. "
Zero-Trust Architecture,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,ZTA is a paradigm shift in security architecture and strategy. Its based on the assumption that a network perimeter is no longer representative of a secure boundary and no implicit trust should be granted to users or services based solely on their physical or network location. 
Infrastructure-as-code,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."
Microservices,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. These services are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies."
SPA,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages. It goes well with the microservices architecture that exposes APIs as their main interface. This technique is further evolved with Micro Frontends also in this radar."
Pipelines for infrastructure ,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"The use of pipelines for infrastructure as code lets you find errors before changes are applied to operational environments — including environments used for development and testing. They also offer a way to ensure that infrastructure tooling is run consistently, using CI/CD agents rather than individual workstations."
TDD,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases."
Continuous Delivery,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the software can be released to production at any time.

You’re doing continuous delivery when: 

Your software is deployable throughout its lifecycle
Your team prioritizes keeping the software deployable over working on new features
Anybody can get fast, automated feedback on the production readiness of their systems any time somebody makes a change to them
You can perform push-button deployments of any version of the software to any environment on demand"
Event-driven architecture,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software architecture paradigm promoting the production, detection, consumption of, and reaction to events. An event can be defined as ""a significant change in state"". For example, when a consumer purchases a car, the car's state changes from ""for sale"" to ""sold""."
Feature toggles/flags,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"A feature toggle is a software development process used to enable or disable functionality remotely without deploying code. New features can be deployed without making them visible to users. Feature flags help decouple deployment from release letting you manage the full lifecycle of a feature.
Their purpose is to use known information to control how code works. For example, if new features are made available to internal users for testing and feedback, a feature flag can control this access. Any employee logged into the application with a corporate email address will see the feature; other users do not.
Feature flags eliminate the need to maintain multiple feature branches within your source code. All code changes can be made to the primary branch, only when the feature is ready will it be enabled via the flag.
To prevent complex capability matrices from spawning, toggles should be removed as soon as a feature has been adopted. Differential usage for the user population should be managed using permissions long-term."
Role-Based Access Control,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments."
Service mesh,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"A service mesh is a configurable, low‑latency infrastructure layer designed to handle a high volume of network‑based interprocess communication among application infrastructure services using application programming interfaces (APIs). A service mesh ensures that communication among containerized and often ephemeral application infrastructure services is fast, reliable, and secure. The mesh provides critical capabilities including service discovery, load balancing, encryption, observability, traceability, authentication and authorization, and support for the circuit breaker pattern.

The service mesh is usually implemented by providing a proxy instance, called a sidecar, for each service instance. Sidecars handle interservice communications, monitoring, and security‑related concerns – indeed, anything that can be abstracted away from the individual services. This way, developers can handle development, support, and maintenance for the application code in the services; operations teams can maintain the service mesh and run the app."
Homomorphic Encryption,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Fully homomorphic encryption (HE) refers to a class of encryption methods that allow computations (such as search and arithmetic) to be performed directly on encrypted data. The result of such a computation remains in encrypted form, which at a later point can be decrypted and revealed. Although the HE problem was first proposed in 1978, a solution wasn't constructed until 2009. With advances in computing power and the availability of easy-to-use open-source libraries — including SEAL, Lattigo, HElib and partially homomorphic encryption in Python — HE is becoming feasible in real-world applications. The motivating scenarios include privacy-preserving use cases, where computation can be outsourced to an untrusted party, for example, running computation on encrypted data in the cloud, or enabling a third party to aggregate homomorphically encrypted intermediate federated machine learning results. "
Continuous delivery for machine learning (CD4ML),Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Continuous Delivery for Machine Learning (CD4ML) is a software engineering approach in which a cross-functional team produces machine learning applications based on code, data, and models in small and safe increments that can be reproduced and reliably released at any time, in short adaptation cycles."
Ethical bias testing,Assess,Techniques,,"There is rising concern that machine learning and deep neural networks in particular could cause unintentional harm. For example, a model could be trained inadvertently to make profitable credit decisions by simply excluding disadvantaged applicants. Ethical bias testing can help uncover potentially harmful decisions in these models. 
Tools such as lime, AI Fairness 360 or What-If Tool can help uncover inaccuracies that result from underrepresented groups in training data and visualization tools such as Google Facets or Facets Dive can be used to discover subgroups within a corpus of training data."
Micro frontends,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,Micro frontends are a new pattern where web application UIs (front ends) are composed from semi-independent fragments that can be built by different teams using different technologies. Micro-frontend architectures resemble back-end architectures where back ends are composed from semi-independent microservices.
Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) using Bloom Filters,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Privacy-preserving record linkage (PPRL) using Bloom filter (a space-efficient probabilistic data structure) is an established technique that allows probabilistic linkage of records from different data providers without exposing privately identifiable personal data. For example, when linking data from two data providers, each provider encrypts its personally identifiable data using Bloom filter to get cryptographic linkage keys and then sends them to you via a secure channel. Once data is received, the records can be linked by computing similarity scores between sets of cryptographic linkage keys from each provider."
Automated machine learning (AutoML),Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML covers the complete pipeline from the raw dataset to the deployable machine learning model. AutoML was proposed as an artificial intelligence-based solution to the ever-growing challenge of applying machine learning. The high degree of automation in AutoML allows non-experts to make use of machine learning models and techniques without requiring them to become experts in machine learning. Automating the process of applying machine learning end-to-end additionally offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform hand-designed models. AutoML has been used to compare the relative importance of each factor in a prediction model"
Hierachical multi-tenancy,Assess,Techniques,TRUE,"Designing security model for multi-tenancy applications is challenging, especially when we develop a cloud-based system that must support hierarchical users, multiple access levels and hierarchical service data. In this paper, we present hierarchical multi-tenant pattern to model hierarchical multi-tenancy and security aspects (hierarchical data authentication and authorization) of a cloud-based software system. This pattern proposes a consistent and flexible blueprint to manage multiple tenants, security and service data that require hierarchy based on real world scenarios. "
"Managing state using config management tools (Chef, Ansible etc)",Hold,Techniques,TRUE,"""Handcranking"" of Hadoop clusters happens when using config management tools such as Ansible, Chef and others. Although these tools are great at provisioning immutable infrastructure components, they're not very useful when you have to manage stateful systems and can often lead to significant effort trying to manage and evolve clusters using these tools."
Legacy migration feature parity,Hold,Techniques,TRUE,"When planning to migrate a legacy service to an updated services, we should resist marking every feature in the leagcy service a requirement for migraiton. Rather the need for each feature needs to be examined individually and only ported in to the new services if there is sufficient value in doing so. "
Consumer-driven Contract Testing,Hold,Techniques,TRUE,"Contract testing is a methodology for ensuring that two separate systems (such as two microservices) are compatible and are able to communicate with one other. It captures the interactions that are exchanged between each service, storing them in a contract, which can then be used to verify that both parties adhere to it. Contract testing goes beyond schema testing, requiring both parties to come to a consensus on the allowed set of interactions and allowing for evolution over time."
Event Sourcing,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"Event sourcing refers to a collection of patterns based on persisting the full history of a domain as a sequence of “events”, rather than persisting just the current state. Events are stored as immutable pieces of data that record what event happened, along with any data that is relevant to that event. Events are stored in streams, with a stream of events representing the entire history of a particular entity (or Aggregate in DDD terminology). These event streams are the source of truth for the state of the aggregate.
See CQRS, Kafka for related items."
The three Rs of security,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"The three Rs of enterprise security — rotate, repair and repave — take advantage of infrastructure automation and continuous delivery to eliminate opportunities for attack. Rotating credentials, applying patches as soon as they're available and rebuilding systems from a known, secure state — all within a matter of minutes or hours — makes it harder for attackers to succeed."
CQRS,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"The Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern separates read and update operations for a data store. Implementing CQRS can maximize performance, scalability, and security. The flexibility created by migrating to CQRS allows a system to better evolve over time and prevents update commands from causing merge conflicts at the domain level."
Data Mesh,Adopt,Techniques,TRUE,"Data mesh is an architectural and organizational paradigm shift in how we manage big analytical data. The paradigm is founded on four principles: (1) domain-oriented decentralization of data ownership and architecture; (2) domain-oriented data served as a product; (3) self-serve data infrastructure as a platform to enable autonomous, domain-oriented data teams; and (4) federated governance to enable ecosystems and interoperability. At GBG it goes beyond analytical data, to extend across the many differnt data sources we utilise. By setting out the principles through which data is acquired, managed and retrieved, it allows to build product services that effectively combine multiple data sources, internal and external, to provide data-driven services. "
Run cost as architecture fitness function,Trial,Techniques,TRUE,"Automating the estimation, tracking and projection of cloud infrastructure's run cost is necessary for today's organizations. The cloud providers' savvy pricing models, combined with the proliferation of pricing parameters and the dynamic nature of today's architecture, can lead to surprisingly expensive run costs. For example, the price of serverless based on API calls, event streaming solutions based on traffic or data processing clusters based on running jobs, all have a dynamic nature that changes over time as the architecture evolves. When our teams manage infrastructure on the cloud, implementing run cost as architecture fitness function is one of their early activities. This means that our teams can observe the cost of running services against the value delivered; when they see deviations from what was expected or acceptable, they'll discuss whether it's time to evolve the architecture. The observation and calculation of the run cost is implemented as an automated function."
Figma,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"Go-to tool for collaborative design, not only for designers but for multidisciplinary teams too; it allows developers and other roles to view and comment on designs through the browser without the desktop version. Compared to its competitors (e.g., Invision or Sketch) which have you use more than one tool for versioning, collaborating and design sharing, Figma puts together all of these features in one tool that makes it easier for our teams to discover new ideas together. Our teams find Figma very useful, especially in remote and distributed design work enablement and facilitation. In addition to its real-time design and collaboration capabilities, Figma also offers an API that helps to improve the DesignOps process."
Terraform,Adopt,Tools,FALSE,"Terraform, is rapidly becoming a de facto choice for creating and managing cloud infrastructures by writing declarative definitions. Already used across many teams in GBG and championed by the Cloud Infrastructure team it is our current infrastructure-as-code tool of choice. "

Elastic Common Schema,Hold,Tools,TRUE,"ECS is an open source specification that defines a common set of document fields for log events most commonly ingested into ElasticSearch. Every component has their won naming conventiobnts for data attributes, complicating ingestion rules and hindering cross componenet analysis without transformation. The adoption of a common schema mitigates these issues. There is a lack of competing schemas and with Elastic's expanding market penetration it is a good shcema to implement today, knowing it will be most likley supported well across vendors tomorrow.
